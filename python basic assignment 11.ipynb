    "Ans: Using logging we can create and disable lower level logging messege it also provide timestamp. it is helpful during debugging.Logging is a more formal process of printing out program state and execution.  If you identify things you want to monitor, you can leave the logging statements in your code, and then selectively turn on the ones you want to print.  Logs let you answer questions like “How often did our pneumatics fire?” or “What command was running just before we experienced a brownout?” or “Which autonomous program executed and what happened during that command?"
